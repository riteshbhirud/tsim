        Unlike the stim.Circuit.detector_error_model() method, this method allows for non-deterministic observables
        when `allow_gauge_detectors` is set to true.

        Args:
            decompose_errors: Defaults to false. When set to true, the error analysis attempts to decompose the
                components of composite error mechanisms (such as depolarization errors) into simpler errors, and
                suggest this decomposition via `stim.target_separator()` between the components. For example, in an
                XZ surface code, single qubit depolarization has a Y error term which can be decomposed into simpler
                X and Z error terms. Decomposition fails (causing this method to throw) if it's not possible to
                decompose large errors into simple errors that affect at most two detectors.

                This is not supported by tsim and setting it to true will raise an error. The argument is present
                for compatibility with stim.
            flatten_loops: Defaults to false. When set to true, the output will not contain any `repeat` blocks.
                When set to false, the error analysis watches for loops in the circuit reaching a periodic steady
                state with respect to the detectors being introduced, the error mechanisms that affect them, and the
                locations of the logical observables. When it identifies such a steady state, it outputs a repeat
                block. This is massively more efficient than flattening for circuits that contain loops, but creates
                a more complex output.

                Irrelevant unless allow_gauge_detectors=False.
            allow_gauge_detectors: Defaults to false. When set to false, the error analysis verifies that detectors
                in the circuit are actually deterministic under noiseless execution of the circuit.

                Note that, unlike in stim, logical observables are also allowed to be non-deterministic.
            approximate_disjoint_errors: Defaults to false. When set to false, composite error mechanisms with
                disjoint components (such as `PAULI_CHANNEL_1(0.1, 0.2, 0.0)`) can cause the error analysis to throw
                exceptions (because detector error models can only contain independent error mechanisms). When set
                to true, the probabilities of the disjoint cases are instead assumed to be independent
                probabilities. For example, a ``PAULI_CHANNEL_1(0.1, 0.2, 0.0)` becomes equivalent to an
                `X_ERROR(0.1)` followed by a `Z_ERROR(0.2)`. This assumption is an approximation, but it is a good
                approximation for small probabilities.

                This argument can also be set to a probability between 0 and 1, setting a threshold below which the
                approximation is acceptable. Any error mechanisms that have a component probability above the
                threshold will cause an exception to be thrown.
            ignore_decomposition_failures: Defaults to False.
                When this is set to True, circuit errors that fail to decompose into graphlike
                detector error model errors no longer cause the conversion process to abort.
                Instead, the undecomposed error is inserted into the output. Whatever tool
                the detector error model is then given to is responsible for dealing with the
                undecomposed errors (e.g. a tool may choose to simply ignore them).

                Irrelevant unless decompose_errors=True.
            block_decomposition_from_introducing_remnant_edges: Defaults to False.
                Requires that both A B and C D be present elsewhere in the detector error model
                in order to decompose A B C D into A B ^ C D. Normally, only one of A B or C D
                needs to appear to allow this decomposition.

                Remnant edges can be a useful feature for ensuring decomposition succeeds, but
                they can also reduce the effective code distance by giving the decoder single
                edges that actually represent multiple errors in the circuit (resulting in the
                decoder making misinformed choices when decoding).
